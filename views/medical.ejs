        <h2>The Rise of Personalized Medicine</h2>
        <div class="blog-preview">What if your treatment was made just for you? That’s the magic of personalized medicine. Here’s how it works...</div>
        <div class="blog-content hidden">
            Personalized medicine is like custom tailoring but for your health. Using your genetic makeup, doctors can predict which treatments will work best for you. For example, instead of a one-size-fits-all cancer treatment, personalized approaches target the unique traits of your tumor. It’s precision healthcare at its finest! The catch? It’s still expensive and requires advanced genetic testing. But as technology evolves, personalized medicine is becoming more accessible, offering hope for better outcomes and fewer side effects. The future of medicine is personal, and it’s looking bright! 🧬✨
